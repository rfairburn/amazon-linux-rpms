RPMs for python libraries and spacewalk client to run on Amazon Linux 2015.03.

.. note::

    These are the specfiles and patches that I use to run spacewalk on Amazon Linux 2015.03.
    Additionally there are some python libraries for use with Saltstack as well.  These will
    _only_ work on Amazon Linux 2015.03!
